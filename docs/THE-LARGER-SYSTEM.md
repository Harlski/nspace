# The larger system — Nimiq Space

This document collects **design principles** and **important design decisions** for Nimiq Space (`nspace`). It is intentionally allowed to be **incomplete**: the goal is to record what matters for a coherent, evolvable product and codebase, and to refine it over time.

**How to use it**

- Before substantial design or implementation work, **read this file** and check whether existing principles apply or conflict.
- When you make or confirm a cross-cutting decision (world model, sync, extensibility, UX philosophy, monetization boundaries, etc.), **update this document** with a short, durable note rather than relying only on chat or one-off PR descriptions.
- **Whenever you intentionally change this file** (add, remove, or materially reword principles or recorded decisions), you **must** also create a new companion file at **`docs/reasons/reason_{unique_6digit_id}.md`** (six digits, unique among existing `docs/reasons/reason_*.md` names). That file should explain **why** `THE-LARGER-SYSTEM` was updated and **how** the change better supports the goals of the larger system (coherence, evolvability, and clear direction). Typos and formatting-only fixes do not require a reason file.

**Relationship to other docs**

- [features-checklist.md](features-checklist.md) and implementation docs describe **current behavior**.
- [brainstorm/README.md](brainstorm/README.md) holds **non-normative** exploration; do not treat it as product truth.
- **This file** sits in between: it is **normative for direction and principles** where we have agreed them, without replacing detailed specs.

## Principles (living)

_Add sections here as the system matures. Keep each bullet concrete enough that a future implementer knows what “good” looks like._

- Prefer designs that **scale from simple to rich** without rewriting core contracts (e.g. identifiers, message shapes, room authority) unless there is a deliberate migration story.

- **Client-only visuals on authoritative world objects** — Sparkles, auras, and similar **non-gameplay** overlays on server-owned geometry (e.g. placed obstacles) stay **client render only**: they do not change server state. They must **not** participate in block ray picks or build-mode selection **bounds** unless they are intentionally part of the solid body. Mark decorative children explicitly (e.g. `userData.skipBlockPickAndBounds` in [client/src/game/Game.ts](../client/src/game/Game.ts)) and derive selection outlines from solid `THREE.Mesh` descendants only (`blockGroupWorldBoundsForSelectionOutline`).

## Recorded decisions & forward constraints

### Tiles: per-cell customization (future)

**Today:** floor presentation is largely limited to **color** (and the current tile mesh assumptions documented in [tile.md](tile.md)).

**Direction:** we want to be able to **customize individual tiles** with arbitrary content over time—not only a solid floor color. Nothing is required for this yet; when we implement it, favor:

- A clear split between **tile data** (what a cell *is*) and **rendering** (meshes, materials, decals, props).
- A path for **persistence and authority** if tile state is shared or player-owned (server as source of truth where gameplay or fairness matters).

Update this subsection when the data model or sync story is chosen.

### Release line: patch notes + semver on merge

**Intent:** One clear moment ties **shipping semver** (root `package.json`) to **frozen patch notes**, so `main` always carries a coherent “what we just released” folder without hand-renaming drift.

**Human / agent cue:** **“Prepare for merge”** (to `main`) means: run **`npm run prepare-merge`** first (default **patch** bump; use `--minor` or `--major` when the change set warrants it). That command:

1. Renames `patchnote/versions/UNRELEASED/` → `patchnote/versions/<next-semver>/` and rewrites `UNRELEASED` markers inside those markdown files to that version.
2. Bumps the **root** `package.json` `version` to the same `<next-semver>`.
3. Creates a fresh `patchnote/versions/UNRELEASED/` with empty starter `reasons.md` and `public/*.md` templates for the next cycle.

After that, the author **reviews diffs**, then **`git add`**, **`git commit`**, **`git push origin main`**. The version is **already in the commit**; there is no separate post-push versioning step unless you add release tagging in CI later.

**Norm:** Do not merge accumulated `UNRELEASED` work to `main` without running `prepare-merge` (or an equivalent manual freeze that keeps folder name and `package.json` in lockstep). Agents assisting with merges should run or insist on this script when the user says they are ready to merge.
